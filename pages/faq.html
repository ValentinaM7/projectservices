                                What is the difference between a conventional pole spear and a Roller polespear?

                                <p>A Roller polespear utilises the full potential of stored energy in its power band,
                                    meaning it delivers power/ thrust for the entire stroke up until the pole leaves the
                                    hunters hand. Whilst a conventional pole spear relies on momentum and thus has no
                                    driving power
                                    once the band has returned to its relaxed state. This is usually around 30% of its
                                    overall stretch. </p>
                                <p>In short, the roller pole can be said to be 30 percent more powerful
                                    for a given power
                                    band. </p>
                                <p><i> Side note: a conventional pole spear requires the user to induce a half twist in
                                        the
                                        band when loading, to reduce the band just loading up one side of the pole and
                                        creating a bend.
                                        Whilst because of the nature of a Roller polespear, the forces are equal either
                                        side
                                        of the pole so the spear stays straight without any input from the Hunter.
                                        Roller polespears just make sense and once you have used one you too will
                                        understand
                                        the simplicity and effectiveness of them.</i></p>

                                <p>During controlled testing -having accuracy and penetrating power at the forefront-,
                                    the BOONDI roller consistently would hit a palm sized target from 9 ft (2.75m) away
                                    (measuring from spear tip to target) this included adequate penetration for average

                                    material in both strength and stiffness. Contrary to popular belief, a ridge spear
                                    will hold and store energy for longer, resulting in better accuracy and penetration

                                <p>The short answer is NO! </p>
                                <p>And here is why…. A BOONDI roller polespear, although it may sound and appear as a
                                    complex piece of equipment, is a very primitive hunting tool perfected with advances
                                    in materials technology and mechanical understanding.</p>
                                <p>Yes, pole spearfishing with average quality (cheap poles) is very frustrating and
                                    usually unproductive – especially when it comes to hunting larger or faster table
                                    fish. The BOONDI carbon fibre / Stainless Steel structure makes it incredibly
                                    <strong>rigid, balanced and fast </strong> through the water.
                                    Why is this important? The <strong>stiffer</strong> the pole <strong> the more
                                        energy</strong> can be transferred to your target when it hits. A pole that is
                                    too light retains no <strong>inertia</strong> when it strikes thus resulting in
                                    little or no <strong>penetration</strong>. On the contrary, a heavy pole will
                                    require too much power to initiate acceleration making it difficult or impossible
                                    for the user to hold loaded for sustainable times.
                                    Also too heavy of a pole will sink very fast thus <strong>accuracy</strong> will
                                    drop or the user will need to mostly take advantage of ‘downhill’ shots.
                                    <strong>Speed assists in accuracy</strong>, as the fish has less time to move as it
                                    senses the pole moving towards itself. A
                                    slower and thicker pole will also require more energy to manoeuvre through water.
                                    After
                                    years of workshop and infield testing, we believe we have come up with the perfect
                                    polespear for you!
                                </p>

                                    easier
                                    and more enjoyable overall.</p>
                                <p>As a beginner you are going to make mistakes, and inevitably hit rocks and coral on
                                    occasions. Having a strong and impact resistant (630 stainless hardened) injector
                                    rod and slip tip will mean it stays sharper and straighter for longer. Customisable
                                    power band setting allows the user to adjust power/ holding resistance for the given
                                    target species. A BOONDI roller is built tough! Not only to take on world record
                                    fish but tough to be a harvesting tool. Therefore, it won’t let you down even when
                                    you
                                    punish it..</p>

                                        bottom time and eventually your depth, allowing you to better understand your

                                <p>Just like hunting land animals, we have choices - some people choose to use a Rifle whilst others choose a compound bow… We find the use of a polespear is a much more intimate
                                    way of hunting compared to speargun. A polespear requires the hunter to hold the
                                    tension of the loaded rubber, until you’re ready to release. When you do release
                                    successfully, your pole hits with such force that the combination of sight and sound
                                    awakens our inner primal hunter. Not only can the polespear be loaded and released
                                    quickly, it can be reloaded without needing to rerig cords or engage spears in
                                    mechanisms, as you would with a speargun. Simply repeat the process and shoot again,
                                    giving you multiple chances of hitting your target before it swims away. The
                                    polespear is a simple hunting tool and is very rewarding to use due to its close
                                    quarters nature.</p>
                                    <p><i>Note: In some countries like the Bahamas in an effort for fish stock conservation, the use of spearguns is prohibited and spearfishing can only be done by polespear or sling. This is not the case in Australia.</i></p>

                                <p>Yes, you can use a float or belt reel when using your polespear - simply clip your belt reel or float to the handle loop attachment point. We recommend clipping to the handle loop and not to the end of the pole/roller housing - as this can slow down the shot of the polespear when fired. However, if the floatline or reel is attached to the handle loop D-ring, the polespear is able to travel most of the effective range without dragging the line through the water, because the hand loop remains stationary until the pole travels out of the hunters hand.  For this reason, we recommend inspecting your rubber and constrictor knots regularly to ensure that they will not fail which could result in you losing your polespear.  </p>
